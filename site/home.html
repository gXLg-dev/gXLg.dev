        <div class="title">APIs & Backend Development</div>
        <div>

      <div class="text">
        <div>
          I set myself apart by offering a direct, personalized, and transparent approach that eliminates unnecessary complexity.
          Here's what makes me different:
        </div>
        <div class="title">Direct & Personal Communication</div>
        <div>
          Communication can take place on whichever platform is most comfortable for you.
          I keep things simple - no ticketing systems, no bureaucracy. You work directly with me,
          ensuring a streamlined and responsive experience.
        </div>
        <div class="title">Tailored Solutions Without Compromise</div>
        <div>
          Unlike generic website builders or agencies that use pre-made templates,
          every project I develop is built from scratch, specifically for you.
        </div>
        <div class="title">Fair & Transparent Pricing</div>
        <div>
          No hidden fees, no overpriced service bundles.
          My pricing is based on actual requirements and the value you receive.

      <div class="heading" ricon="money-euro-circle-line">Pricing & Payment</div>
      <div class="text">
        <div>
          My pricing structure is simple and based on two main components:
        </div>
        <div class="title">Development & Domain Fee</div>
        <div>
          This is a one-time payment based on the complexity and scope of your project.<br>
          If a domain was registered through me, details regarding domain costs will be outlined in the final contract.
        </div>
        <div class="title">Monthly Hosting Fee</div>
        <div>
          For clients who choose hosting with me, I offer a fixed monthly rate,
          with adjustments only if additional resources (RAM, extra storage, etc.) are required.
        </div>
        <div class="title">No Upfront Payment</div>
        <div>
          You only pay when your project is fully completed and delivered.
        </div>
        <div class="title">Cancellation Policy</div>
        <div>
          You can cancel your service at any time.
        </div>
        <div class="title">Upgrade Options</div>
        <div>
          If your project grows and requires more resources,
          I will adjust your hosting plan - as long as it remains within my supported limits.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <div class="heading" ricon="customer-service-line">Support & Maintenance</div>
      <div class="text">
        <div>
          All services come with ongoing support to ensure smooth operation.
        </div>
        <div class="title">Bug Fixes & Issue Resolution</div>
        <div>
          If there's a problem caused by programming errors or unforeseen edge cases,
          I'll fix it at <span class="keyword">no extra cost</span>.
        </div>
        <div class="title">Custom Modifications</div>
        <div>
          If you need additional features or adjustments after delivery, they can be arranged -
          either as part of support or for an additional fee, depending on scope.
        </div>
        <div class="title">Security & Backups</div>
        <div>
          SSL/TLS encryption is included for all web projects.<br>
          Backups are available upon request.
        </div>
        <div class="title">Client Management & Statistics</div>
        <div>
          If needed, I can develop custom analytics dashboards to track
          key metrics for your website or service.
