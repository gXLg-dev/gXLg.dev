0. Definitions

In these Terms and Conditions, the following terms are used:

* "I" / "me" / "my":
  Refers to the provider: Dmitry Plesunov,
  operating as a self-employed software developer in Germany.

* "you" / "your":
  Refers to you as the customer -
  the person or organization using my services.

* "we" / "us":
  Refers to situations where collaboration or a shared step
  between the provider and the customer is involved.

* "project":
  Refers to the digital product I create for you.

* "contract":
  Refers to the agreement between you and me regarding the
  development and/or hosting of a project.



1. What I Offer

I develop and host digital projects - such as websites,
web apps, and bots (e.g. Discord or Telegram bots).
You pay a one-time development fee and a recurring
monthly hosting fee for using my infrastructure.



2. How We Make a Contract

Before anything is billed, we'll talk about your project.
Here's how it goes:

* We discuss what you need.
* I build the project for you.
* You get 2 weeks to test everything without any payment obligation.
* If you're satisfied, you confirm the contract in your online account.
* Once confirmed, you are billed via Stripe. Your project then goes live.

If you choose not to confirm, nothing happens.
No project goes live, no billing takes place.



3. Payment

* All payments are processed via Stripe.
* You'll receive a receipt for each payment.
* The monthly subscription starts only after contract confirmation.
* No refunds are given for the current billing period after confirmation,
  as the test phase already happened beforehand.
* If your payment method fails, just contact me. I'll cancel the current
  contract and send a new one once the payment details are updated.



4. Cancellation

You can cancel your subscription at any time via your customer portal.
Here's what happens:

* Cancellation is effective immediately in the system (within ~10 minutes).
* Your project stays online until the end of the current billing period,
  then it goes offline.
* If you cancel by mistake or need a new payment setup, just contact me -
  we can start a new contract.
* If you've lost access to your account/email, email me with proof
  (like receipts), and I'll cancel or transfer the account manually.

Once a contract is cancelled, it can't be reactivated. If you want to continue,
a new contract will be offered (with the development fee waived if no
changes are needed).



5. Uptime and Service

* I aim for 24/7 uptime. Exceptions include things outside my control
  (e.g. power outages, natural disasters).
* If downtime is my fault, I'll fix it as soon as possible.
* If downtime lasts longer than a full month, I'll refund the hosting
  fee for that month.
* Backups are available on request, but not done automatically.
* Support includes bugfixes and basic help. Bigger feature requests
  require a new contract.



6. Usage Limits

* Each project has a RAM usage limit, which we'll agree on beforehand.



7. Legal Use and Responsibility

* You must not host illegal content or services on my servers.
* You're also not allowed to violate the terms of third-party
  services (e.g. running a Discord bot that collects user data without permission).
* If illegal or abusive behavior is detected, I reserve the right to terminate
  the service and cancel the contract without notice.
* I'm not responsible for any user-generated content or the legal compliance
  of your project - that's your job.



8. Intellectual Property

* I retain ownership of the project code unless we explicitly agree to open-source it.
* If open-sourced, I'll release it under the MIT License.
* You have the right to use and operate the service during the active contract term.



9. Complaints and Disputes

* Complaints about the service or hosting can be sent directly to me.
* Complaints about your project or user experience must be handled by you.
* German law applies to this agreement.
* Any disputes shall be resolved under the jurisdiction of German courts.



10. Final Notes

* These Terms may be updated in the future.
* Changes only apply to new contracts.
